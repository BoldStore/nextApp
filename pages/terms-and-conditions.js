        <h2>Terms of Sale</h2>
        <p>
          By placing an order you are offering to purchase a product on and
          subject to the following terms and conditions. All orders are subject
          to availability and confirmation of the order price. Dispatch times
          may vary according to availability and subject to any delays resulting
          from postal delays or force majeure for which we will not be
          responsible.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to contract with [https://boldstore.in/] you must be over 18
          years of age and possess a valid credit or debit card issued by a bank
          acceptable to us. [https://boldstore.in/] retains the right to refuse
          any request made by you. If your order is accepted we will inform you
          by email and we will confirm the identity of the party which you have
          contracted with. This will usually be [https://boldstore.in/] or may
          in some cases be a third party. Where a contract is made with a third
          party [https://boldstore.in/] is not acting as either agent or
          principal and the contract is made between yourself and that third
          party and will be subject to the terms of sale which they supply you.
          When placing an order you undertake that all details you provide to us
          are true and accurate, that you are an authorized user of the credit
          or debit card used to place your order and that there are sufficient
          funds to cover the cost of the goods. The cost of foreign products and
          services may fluctuate. All prices advertised are subject to such
          changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Our Contract When you place an order, you will receive an
          acknowledgement e-mail confirming receipt of your order: this email
          will only be an acknowledgement and will not constitute acceptance of
          your order. A contract between us will not be formed until we send you
          confirmation by e-mail that the goods which you ordered have been
          dispatched to you. Only those goods listed in the confirmation e-mail
          sent at the time of dispatch will be included in the contract formed.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Pricing and Availability Whilst we try and ensure that all
          details, descriptions and prices which appear on this Website are
          accurate, errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price of
          any goods which you have ordered we will inform you of this as soon as
          possible and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the
          correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you we
          will treat the order as cancelled. If you cancel and you have already
          paid for the goods, you may or may not receive a full refund. Delivery
          costs will be charged in addition; such additional charges are clearly
          displayed where applicable and included in the &apos;Total Cost&apos;.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Payment Upon receiving your order we carry out a standard
          authorization check on your payment card to ensure there are
          sufficient funds to fulfil the transaction. Your card will be debited
          upon authorisation being received. The monies received upon the
          debiting of your card shall be treated as a deposit against the value
          of the goods you wish to purchase. Payments are handled through
          RazorPay. As of now, no refunds are to be accepted and neither does
          Bold accept Cash on Delivery or ‘COD’ as a form of payment. Once the
          goods have been despatched and you have been sent a confirmation email
          the monies paid as a deposit shall be used as consideration for the
          value of goods you have purchased as listed in the confirmation email.
          Bold uses ShipRocket to carry out the shipment and shipping process
          once a purchase has been made.
